#loop syntax stays very differnt in python as its all about indentation
for x in "Python" :
    print(x) # prints the letters one by one

for q in ['a','b','c']:
    print(q) # prints all the elements of the array

for x in range(0,10,2): #range function has 3 arguments start no, end no and step if step is 2 it prints even numbers
    print(x) # range doesnt return a list
